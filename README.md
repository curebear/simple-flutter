# app

A boilerplate project created in flutter using [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart), [get-it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it), [Chopper](https://pub.dev/packages/chopper), [simple_auth](https://github.com/clancey/simple_auth)


> Basically, the whole architrecture was copied from [flutter-boilerplate-project](https://github.com/zubairehman/flutter-boilerplate-project). In the original project, it used Provider, but we replaced it with Get-It. Http client is auto-generated based on Chopper. OAuth-based authentication is simplified using simple-auth.
